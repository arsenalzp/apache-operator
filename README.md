# Apacheweb-operator
**Apacheweb** operator provides basic features of *Apache HTTPD* server - web server and load balancer by using the extensions of Apache module *mod_proxy_balancer*

## Description
*Apache HTTPD* was the most popular HTTPD server in the near past and remains very popular in the Internet in nowadays, so the main goal of this operator is to bring *Apache HTTPD* features to *Kubernetes* world.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Run operator locally
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Deploy operator on the cluster manually
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/apache-operator:tag
```
	 
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/apache-operator:tag
```

### Create Apacheweb resource for load balancing
```yaml
apiVersion: apacheweb.arsenal.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Apacheweb
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: apacheweb
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: apacheweb-sample
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: apache-operator
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kustomize
    app.kubernetes.io/created-by: apache-operator
  name: apacheweb-sample
spec:
  serverName: "test.example.com"
  size: 2
  type: "lb" # type of operator: use "web" for web server or "lb" for load balancer
  loadBalancer:
    proto: https # proxy protocol
    path: /test # proxy path
    backEndService: remote-server # name of Service forwarding to
```

### Create Apacheweb resource for web server
```yaml
apiVersion: apacheweb.arsenal.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Apacheweb
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: apacheweb
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: apacheweb-sample
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: apache-operator
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kustomize
    app.kubernetes.io/created-by: apache-operator
  name: apacheweb-sample
spec:
  serverName: "test.example.com"
  size: 2
  type: "web" # type of operator: use "web" for web server or "lb" for load balancer
  webServer:
    documentRoot: /usr/local/apache2
    serverAdmin: test@example.com
    serverPort: 8888
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f apacheweb.yaml
```

If you use **Apacheweb** as load balancer, don't forget labeling the Servie resource which was put in *spec.loadBalancer.backEndService* - this service is used as a source of a target (remote) endpoints.

```bash
kubectl label service remote-server "kubernetes.io/service-name=remote-server"
```

```bash
k describe apachewebs.apacheweb.arsenal.dev apacheweb-sample

```

You can use a *Service* for **Apacheweb** resources to destribute workloads between the load balancers

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
<<<<<<< HEAD
```

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
